During the course of the last project, I got more and more seasoned for visualization of dashboards in QlikView and Tableau. Some important principles that I have been tested on were patience, perfection, punctuality and meeting deadlines while working on those projects. Apart from BI Tools, I have appreciable knowledge in other tools and technology that you can find listed below.Apart from my professional life, I love travelling, swimming, reading fictional novels, singing and quizzing.\r\n",
