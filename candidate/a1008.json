Unauthorized or incorrect changes to a single device can have a rippling effect on the health and availability of the network infrastructure. A good network fault and performance management solution is a necessity for keeping the network up and running. WiMAX NMS solution provides end-to-end visibility by alerting network operations are in jeopardy. Preventing network problems is an opportunity to increase network uptime, provide better business services and improve business continuity. WiMAX NMS aims to reduce the operational complexity by providing a single interface for the network operator to centrally monitor and control the end-to-end (E2E) telecommunication network. NMS is an integrated solution to provide fault, configuration and performance management of the network. It helps the network operator to detect root-cause of the network faults. It alerts the network operator of any service-impacting performance bottlenecks by proactively monitoring the E2E network performance\n\nProject Duration November 2009 to till date\n\nResponsibilities Involved in Analysis, Design, Coding, and Testing of Application.
